# MaxCleaner: A Robust Data Preprocessing Toolkit

## Overview

**TextCleaner** is a comprehensive Python library designed to streamline and enhance the data preprocessing stage for text-based datasets. It provides a suite of powerful tools for cleaning, standardizing, and enriching textual data, enabling you to build more accurate and reliable machine learning models.

This library is designed with flexibility and efficiency in mind, offering various processing strategies (sequential, multiprocessing, and vectorized) to cater to datasets of varying sizes and computational resources.  It intelligently handles common data issues, provides robust URL and datetime standardization, and integrates seamlessly with the popular pandas DataFrame structure.

## Key Features

*   **Text Cleaning:**
    *   Removes noise, handles whitespace irregularities, and normalizes text.
    *   Offers flexible word splitting using multiple strategies, including camelCase, snake\_case, and kebab-case.
    *   Provides specialized cleaning for specific text types (e.g., football datasets).

*   **URL Standardization:**
    *   Standardizes URLs, removes unnecessary query parameters (UTM tracking, etc.), normalizes case, and handles trailing slashes.
    *   Extracts links from HTML content and identifies potential broken links.
    *   Caches URL parsing for increased efficiency.

*   **Datetime Processing:**
    *   Detects and standardizes datetime formats within text and in DataFrame columns.
    *   Provides configurable output formats and robust error handling.

*   **Multilingual Support:**
    *   Supports multiple languages through integration with the NLTK library.

*   **Scalable Processing:**
    *   Offers sequential, multiprocessing, and vectorized processing strategies for optimal performance.
    *   Memory monitoring to prevent out-of-memory errors.

*   **Pandas Integration:**
    *   Seamlessly integrates with pandas DataFrames, making it easy to process entire datasets with a single function call.

*   **NLTK Integration (Optional):**
    *   Leverages NLTK for advanced text processing features such as tokenization, stop word removal, and lemmatization (if NLTK is installed).

*   **Configurable:**
    *   Highly configurable through a `CleanerConfig` dataclass, allowing you to tailor the cleaning process to your specific needs.
